  abstract = {Museums and Cultural Heritage institutions have a growing interest in presenting their collections
              to a broader community via the Internet. The photo-realistic presentation of interactively
              inspectable virtual surrogates is one of the most challenging problems in this field. For this
              purpose, we seek to employ not only a 3D geometry but also a powerful material representation
              capable of reproducing the full visual appeal of an object. In this article, we propose a
              WebGL-based presentation framework in which reflectance information is represented via Bidirectional
              Texture Functions (BTF). Our approach works out-of-the-box in modern Web browsers and allows for the
              progressive transmission and interactive rendering of digitized artifacts consisting of 3D geometry
              and reflectance information. We handle the huge amount of data needed for this representation by
              employing a novel progressive streaming approach for BTFs, which allows for the smooth interactive
              inspection of a steadily improving version during the download. We demonstrate an interesting
              use-case of this technique at a cross section of Cultural Heritage, medical education, and research
              and provide an evaluation of the capabilities of our framework in the scope of BTF compression and
              transmission.},

              role in computer graphics, computer vision and industry. They enable applications such as digital
              material design, virtual prototyping and faithful virtual surrogates for entertainment, marketing,
              education or cultural heritage documentation. A particularly fruitful way to obtain the digital
              appearance is the acquisition of reflectance from real-world material samples. Therefore, a great
              variety of devices to perform this task has been proposed. In this work, we investigate their
              practical usefulness. We first identify a set of necessary attributes and establish a general
              categorization of different designs that have been realized. Subsequently, we provide an in-depth
              discussion of three particular implementations by our work group, demonstrating advantages and
              disadvantages of different system designs with respect to the previously established attributes.

    abstract = {Efficient and realistic rendering of cloth is of great interest
                especially in the context of e-commerce. Aside from the simulation
                of cloth draping, the rendering has to provide the "look and feel"
                of the fabric itself. In this paper we present a novel interactive
                rendering algorithm to preserve this "look and feel" of different
                fabrics. This is done by using the bidirectional texture function
                (BTF) of the fabric, which is acquired from a rectangular probe
                and after synthesis, mapped onto the simulated geometry. Instead
                of fitting a special type of bidirectional reflection distribution
                function (BRDF) model to each texel of our BTF, we generate
                view-dependent texture-maps using a principal component analysis
                of the original data. These view-dependent texture maps are then
                illuminated and rendered using either point-light sources or high
                dynamic range environment maps by exploiting current graphics
                hardware. In both cases, self-shadowing caused by geometry is
                taken into account. For point light sources, we also present a
                novel method to generate smooth shadow boundaries on the geometry.
                Depending on the geometrical complexity and the sampling density
                of the environment map, the illumination can be changed
                interactively. To ensure interactive frame rates for denser
                samplings or more complex objects, we introduce a principal
                component based decomposition of the illumination of the geometry.
                The high quality of the results is demonstrated by several
                examples. The algorithm is also suitable for materials other than
                cloth, as far as these materials have a similar reflectance
                behavior.},

               appearance of many real-world materials as they contain the spatially varying
               light scattering behavior of the material surface. Since editing of existing BTF
               data is still in its early stages, materials have to be measured from real-world
               samples. In contrast to the related Spatially Varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs), the
               reflectance information encoded in a BTF also includes non-local scattering
               effects and therefore does not obey energy conservation or reciprocity. While
               this higher degree of freedom also contributes to an increased realism, it
               inadvertently calls for an extensive measurement of reflectance samples, as many
               regularization approaches from BRDF measurement do not apply. In this paper, we
               present an automated, parallelized, robust, fast and transportable setup for the
               acquisition of BTFs from flat samples as well as 3D objects using camera and
               light arrays: the DOME II. In contrast to previous camera array approaches, the
               present setup, which is comprised of high-quality industry grade components,
               overcomes several issues regarding stability, reliability and precision. It
               achieves a well balanced state-of-the-art acquisition performance in terms of

                  materials can be described as 2D-texture under varying light- and view direction namely the
                  Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). Since an easy and general method for modeling BTFs is not

	abstract = {We present a method to acquire the reflectance field of a human face and use these measurements to render the face under arbitrary changes in lighting and viewpoint. We first acquire images of the face from a small set of viewpoints under a dense sampling of incident illumination directions using a light stage. We then construct a reflectance function image for each observed image pixel from its values over the space of illumination directions. From the reflectance functions, we can directly generate images of the face from the original viewpoints in any form of sampled or computed illumination. To change the viewpoint, we use a model of skin reflectance to estimate the appearance of the reflectance functions for novel viewpoints. We demonstrate the technique with synthetic renderings of a person's face under novel illumination and viewpoints.},

abstract = {We propose a simple method to acquire and reconstruct material appearance with sparsely sampled data. Our technique renders elaborate view- and light-dependent effects and faithfully reproduces materials such as fabrics and knitwears. Our approach uses sparse measurements to reconstruct a full six-dimensional Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). Our reconstruction only require input images from the top view to be registered, which is easy to achieve with a fixed camera setup. Bidirectional properties are acquired from a sparse set of viewing directions through image statistics and therefore precise registrations for these views are unnecessary. Our technique is based on multi-scale histograms of image pyramids. The full BTF is generated by matching the corresponding pyramid histograms to interpolated top-view images.We show that the use of multi-scale image statistics achieves a visually plausible appearance. However, our technique does not fully capture sharp specularities or the geometric aspects of parallax. Nonetheless, a large class of materials can be reproduced well with our technique, and our statistical characterization enables acquisition of such materials efficiently using a simple setup.}
