In Section \ref{section:algorithm_step} matrices $U$, $\Sigma$ and $V$ store all the data  needed to render the BTF.
Matrices $\Sigma$ and $V$ are small in size and they are sent in the first place. On the contrary, most of the information is stored in the matrix $U$, which stores principal components.
On the client side before streaming, matrix $U$ is initialized with blank values, for example zeros. 
After the Socket connection is established, the client messages the server to send one component at a time. 
 Each component on the WebSockets server is stored as a PNG image, which provides further compression for the BTF.
When a new component fully transferred to the client, it saved to the matrix $U$ and the rendering of the BTF is refreshed.
With each component the quality of the resulting image is progressively enhanced.
Now, with streaming the client is able to see rendered image just in a few seconds.
All matrices on the client are sent to the shader as PNG images.

 The Figure \ref{fig:streaming} illustrates the described streaming process. 
 Components Texture in the Figure \ref{fig:streaming} is the matrix $U$, which saves the transferred principal components.
