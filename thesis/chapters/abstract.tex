Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF) are 6-dimensional functions that depend on the spatial position on a surface, light and camera directions.
 Due to changes either of light or camera directions the appearance of real-world materials can severely change.
 BTF can represent such materials by capturing important material properties for a wide range of illumination changes.

In this work we present a technique to render BTFs at real-time within a web-browser using WebGL. 
The ever-growing number of mobile devices that use web-browsers imply constraints on the hardware capabilities.
Thus, rendering has to be efficient to be possible on such devices and the fact that all data has to be transferred to the client make compression inevitable.  
We employ a principal component analysis to compress the data, which allows for rendering of BTFs with interactive frame rates. 
To provide immediate feedback to the user we additionally use a streaming approach that allows for a progressive enhancement of the rendering quality
while transferring the remaining data to the client.
