Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is a 6-dimensional function that depends on spatial position on a texture surface and on light and camera views.
An appearance of realistic materials drastically changes with light and camera variations.
 BTF can model reliable presentation of such materials and capture reflectance properties with a wide range of illumination variations.

In this work we present WebGL-based rendering of BTF in a web-browser. 
An ever-growing number of mobile devices that use web-browser implies that rendering must be possible for hardware with very limited capabilities.
Also, due to enormous size of BTF - compression step is inevitable. 
We employ a principal component analysis to compress the data, which allows for rendering of BTF with interactive frame rates. 
To provide immediate feedback to the user we provide a solution to stream the BTF data and to progressively enhance the rendering quality while the data downloads.
