 
note that PCA better than pixelwise methods:

As expected, the visual performance of the tested PCA-based methods was quite similar due to sample-dedicated parameters set by the experiment. 
The PTM RF method apparently misses specular highlights and PLM RF slightly increases contrast, which is in accordance with Fig. 10 and Table 5.


possible improvement of compression:
quantization of parameter values, which are floating points
